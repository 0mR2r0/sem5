	abstract = {This paper describes the behavior of the long packed bed heat regenerator in terms of the simple axial dispersion model which has so successfully accounted for nonideal flow of fluids. Thus instead of trying to determine the shape of the evolving temperature front by rigorous or semi-rigorous analytical methods this model characterizes the spreading phenomenon by the moments of its associated Gaussian distribution. This procedure, though approximate, allows one to account for all the factors which contribute to the spreading of the temperature front: axial dispersion of gas, film heat transfer and conduction into the particles. Efficiencies of heat recovery are directly calculable with this model for all sorts of operations: single pass, periodic cocurrent and periodic counter Practically all past analyses of the regenerator assumed that film heat transfer was the dominant mechanism in causing a lowering in performance of the}

	abstract = {Thermal regenerators are compact heat exchangers in which heat is absorbed and released using high heat capacity materials. They have been used in the industries for more than two centuries. There are two applications of the regenerators as a heat recovery system in the processes: fixed-bed and rotary. In the fixed bed regenerators (FBRs) the bed is fixed and the hot and cold streams are periodically passed through the bed while in the rotary type the streams are fixed and the bed is rotating facing each stream. They have been used in the process industries such as aluminum and glass industries and power plants for many years. This paper reviews the basic mathematical models applied in the computer simulation of regenerators over almost 200 years which was taken for the development of Stirling׳s hot engine into a quantitative picture of transient thermal response. A number of original mathematical models are presented for the specific application in the process industries. Three different methods of solutions are introduced and finally, some experimental setup systems used for the verification of simulation results are presented and discussed.}

	ABSTRACT = {Heat regenerators are simple devices for heat transfer, but their proper design is rather difficult. Their design is based on differential equations that need to be solved. This is one of the reasons why these devices are not widely used. There are several methods for solving them that were developed. However, due to the time demands of calculation, these models did not spread too much. With the development of computer technology, the situation changed, and these methods are now relatively easy to apply, as the calculation does not take a lot of time. Another problem arises when selecting a suitable method for calculating the heat transfer coefficient and pressure drop. Their choice depends on the type of packed bed material, and not all available computational equations also provide adequate accuracy. This paper describes the so-called open Willmott methods and provides a basic overview of equations for calculating the regenerative heat exchanger with a fixed bed. Based on the mentioned computational equations, it is possible to create a tailor-made calculation procedure of regenerative heat exchangers. Since no software was found on the market to design regenerative heat exchangers, it had to be created. An example of software implementation is described at the end of the article. The impulse to create this article was also to broaden the awareness of regenerative heat exchangers, to provide designers with an overview of suitable calculation methods and, thus, to extend the interest and use of this type of heat exchanger.},

	abstract = {Regenerative thermal oxidizers (RTO) can be conveniently used to control volatile organic components (VOC) emissions, because of their thermal efficiency and cost effectiveness. In the RTO technology, beds of inert material are used in order to heat the polluted air by cooling burnt gases, through a sequence of cyclic operations which cut the fuel requirements. A computational 1D unsteady model, able to account for both structured and random packed bed regenerators, is developed and applied to realistic plant conditions. Process thermal efficiency and gas pressure drop are calculated as functions of the system geometry and operating parameters. The code can be usefully employed in the analysis and design of RTO systems and in order to choose the more suitable type of regenerator, structured or random packed bed (even considering various particle shapes). Energetic performances of both random and structured regenerators were compared, showing that the first ones exhibit a little higher thermal efficiency but also an elevated pressure drop, at a same value of exchange surface per unit volume of the bed. Random packed bed regenerators resulted less attractive from the energetic point of view and their usage is advisable if their lower cost satisfy economical requirements.}

Four basic groups of models were investigated, that is, the continuous solid phase models, Schumann's model, the single phase models and the thermal diffusion models or models with thermal gradient inside the particles. For each of these models a computer code was written and optimized. The models were first evaluated in relation to the computational time consumed to solve a specific test problem. The models were then compared in relation to the influence of particle size, void fraction, particle material, flow rate variations, working fluid inlet temperature variations and finally wall thermal losses. The results obtained were compared, analysed and discussed}
